In recent times, Heart Disease prediction is one of the most complicated tasks in medical field. In the modern era, approximately one person dies per minute due to heart disease. Data science plays a crucial role in processing huge amount of data in the field of healthcare. As heart disease prediction is a complex task, there is a need to automate the prediction process to avoid risks associated with it and alert the patient well in advance. 
The main challenge in today's healthcare is provision of best quality services and effective accurate diagnosis [1]. Even if heart diseases are found as the prime source of death in the world in recent years, they are also the ones that can be controlled and managed effectively. The whole accuracy in management of a disease lies on the proper time of detection.
The proposed work predicts the chances of Heart Disease and classifies patient's risk level by implementing different data mining techniques such as GaussianNB, Linear REgression, Logistic Regression, KNN and Random Forset Classifier.

The Goal is to predict which patients are most likely to suffer from a heart disease in the near future using the features given.
